# Day-Planner-HW5
-The Day-Planner shows a normal workday of hours and allows you to type and save it locally. This allows you to close the page and reopen and it show the text that you had previously written in the same time slot.
## API's
-This homework uses moment.js, to get time information, and jquery,for simpler coding and statements, for javascript
-And uses bootstrap, google fonts, and font awesome for css stylizing
## Problems
I couldn't figure out how to get rid of the color bleed into the time and save button from the text area.
